<p><a href="https://www.historians.org/ahajobsreport2022">There are more recent humanities* PhDs without tenure-track jobs than there are with.</a></p>
</div>

<div class="parallax1">
<div class="parallaxstat">"The AHA's Where Historians Work survey, which looks at a broader snapshot of time, suggests an upper bound: for those who graduated from a PhD program in 2017, 27 percent (231 of 860) were employed in TT positions four years later in 2021. This contrasts starkly with the data from earlier cohorts. Of those who earned their PhDs in 2013, for example, 54 percent (511 of 944) were employed in TT jobs after four years."</div></div>

<div class="parallax2"></div>


<div class="paragraph">
<p>We do not have current statistics that portray the gravity given the past two years or so since the beginning of the pandemic. What we do have are dozens of studies, think pieces, and blog posts about this crisis, <a href=”https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2013/05/22/essay-defining-alt-ac-new-phd-job-searches”>stemming back from 2010 at the latest</a>. We also have "alt-ac," "PhD Plus," and other euphemistic programs in a growing number of graduate departments, a sign that our administrators recognize this occupational futility but cannot foresee any creative solutions to keeping their students in the scholarly community.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1">
<div class="parallaxstat">"First used on Twitter around three years ago in a conversation between Bethany Nowviskie and Jason Rhody 'alt-ac' was shorthand for 'alternative academic' careers. At the time the term was, in <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2010/alt-ac/" target="_blank">Nowviskie's words</a>, 'a pointed push-back against the predominant phrase, 'nonacademic careers.' 'Non-academic' was the label for anything off the straight and narrow path to tenure.' Three years later, the term 'alt-ac' is commonly used to refer to 'alternative' careers in (and beyond) the academy"</div></div>

<div class="parallax2"></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So institutions are recognizing (and dealing with the graduate trajectory statistical fallout of) the fact that most of us will not receive academic appointments, whether we sought those positions or not. Many of us have found fulfilling careers outside of academia or adjacent institutions, but some have resorted to career paths that were at one point unfathomable. Moreover, a lot of us never even wanted a job in academia. Whatever the case, we all were, at one point, passionate about research, writing, and our scholarly communities, and we now find those activities and those connections challenging to maintain. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scholarly life is fostered in a system that was not designed for us. But there are more of us.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sarah Buchmeier, PhD and park ranger, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/does-leaving-the-university-mean-leaving-academe">wrote about this issue earlier in 2022 in the Chronicle of Higher Education.</a> Her essay includes insights about how it feels to be in your final years of graduate school knowing that you won't be a professor, and her experience trying to be a scholar outside of academia. It is one of the only published pieces of writing we have regarding the ability of "alt-ac" PhDs to stay in their scholarly communities. But her arguments and questions are anecdotal.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1">
<div class="parallaxstat">"Academic conferences now routinely trot out independent scholars for panels on career diversity—but how often are those speakers invited to present their scholarship?"</div></div>

<div class="parallax2"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our belief that PhDs outside of academia are left out of scholarly communities is anecdotal, as well, as there are few statistics on the matter. But we firmly believe it is true, or at the very least, a lot of people whose voices are absent from higher education discourse feel this way.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why are our institutions not serving us beyond conferring our degrees? Think of institutions broadly: our alma maters, granting agencies, or academic societies. Why are they not doing more to serve the largest amount of scholars?
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How can we reorient scholarly communities to align with reality: most of us will not be in prestigious positions. Positions in academia or adjacent institutions tangibly benefit from scholarly publishing, conference presentations, and research granting to get promoted or remain relevant. And importantly, these positions have a mutually beneficial relationship with the granting agencies, nonprofits, and publishers that depend on the labor and products of higher profile scholars to prove to their donors that their grant programs are successful, the acadmeic society is productive, or to continue to sell a nonzero number of books.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those of us whose occupational promotions and relevancy do not depend on an article in the journal of record are just as worthy of participating in the scholarly community as our colleagues with tenure-track jobs. After all, there are more of us. And imagine how rich, diverse, and complex scholarly discourse could be if its participants were a grants manager, a government analyst, a UX designer, and a full-time parent, particularly when that would allow scholars who have historically been left out of scholarly communities to participate.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned, there is a lot of discourse surrounding how to <em>get</em> a job outside academia, or even how to transition from outside academia back into an academic career. Likewise, there are entire forums dedicated to posturing how careers outside academia are, in fact, actually better <em>(!)</em>. But rarely are there conversations about those of us who accept the job outlook but want to continue our scholarly endeavors. So how can all scholars participate in scholarly life, regardless of position or title? We need all of the institutions within higher education to support us.
</p>
</div>
<div class="parallax1"></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need a fuller picture of granting, alumn resources, conference participation, and publishing for scholars outside of academia. We should engage in studies and surveys of the following:
	<div class="list">
<ol>
	<li>Granting
<ul>- Beyond postdoctoral fellowships in the "public humanities," how many humanities grant programs for research, scholarly projects, community projects, etc., target scholars outside of academia?</ul>
<ul>- How many scholars outside academia earn grants that are open to all scholars regardless of institutional affiliation?</ul>
<ul>- What kind of grant programs from state and federal humanities agencies or academic societies should be created to fit the reality of post-graduate scholarly life?</ul></li>

<br><li>Alumn/non-affiliated scholar access to scholarly resources
<ul>- Are the library resources and databases available to alumn suitable for competitive and thorough research for multiple disciplines?</ul>
<ul>- What are the possible creative solutions for providing better resources to alumn, while acknowledging the typical FTE pricing scheme?</ul>
<ul>- Are there other options outside of alumn access?</ul></li>

<br><li>Conferences and academic societies
<ul>- How many non-affiliated scholars present papers at major conferences in various fields?</ul>
<ul>- Do any societies collect statistics on the affiliations of those who submit papers to conferences? Do we know the acceptance rate for affiliated and non-affiliated scholars?</ul></li>

<br><li>Publishing
<ul>- The need to publish for tenure-track professors has created a predatory scholarly publishing industry. 
<ul>- (And an internal question, <em>if we are not professors, why would we willingly participate if our careers do not depend on it? &nbsp;</em>)</ul></ul>
<ul>- Are there non-affiliated scholars who are interested in academic publishing?</ul>
<ul>- If scholars outside of academia published more often, how could that affect the publishing industry?</ul></li>
</ol>
