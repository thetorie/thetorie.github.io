<p>I am a writer, maker, and archivist in Washington, D.C. I am sharing my thoughts on music in society, the state of the humanities, and crafting a personal practice of making during challenging times.</p>

<p>I have PhD in Critical and Comparative Studies in Music and I care deeply about the processes of music making and listening historically and in present day. I am also an avid sewist, cook, and baker, for which I have no accreditation, but I have spent more hours honing these skills than I have reading or writing, so maybe that’s my actual vocation.</p>
