Just finished an amazing fellowship at the <a href='http://scholarslab.org/'>UVa Scholars' Lab</a> where my colleagues and I developed an augmented reality app for UVa's history. Extremely grateful to the Scholars' Lab and my cohort for this opportunity! 

In an effort to make the research that went into such an app more accessible, I developed <a href="http://reveal.scholarslab.org/searchengine">an alternative search engine</a> for UVa's Special Collections. I used the JSON files for individual items from a small database of Special Collections holdings to model a search algorithim that, inspired by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions">regexp</a>, accounts for many variants of or branches from a singular search term within one larger theme.

This method allows for more discoverable research. To that end, the data is displayed visually in dynamic bubbles that are sized relative to the amount of terms found within the item's JSON.

The formatting and Javascript are, of course, a work in progress, and are just one small model of what I hope will be a larger project in the future!
