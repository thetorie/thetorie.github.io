In March, I gave a presentation at the annual meeting of the Society for Amerian Music to promote the use of Native American boarding school archival materials in musicological research. I want to thank the panel and guests for a wonderful, productive conversation. I created a handy resource guide (last updated March 2024), which you can find [here](https://torieclark.com/projects/2024/03/18/Projects.html). 

I will update this guide as more resources become available in the coming months and years, and please join the [Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/5455099/nabs) for Native American boarding school scholarship!
