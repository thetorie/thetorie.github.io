[We Are the Field](wearethefield.io) is now live!

I founded a research collective that seeks to uplift non-affiliated humanities scholars. We believe that scholarly communities should better reflect their constituencies with consideration to the academic hiring crisis in North America. We are researching to better understand how non-affiliated scholars are involved in scholarly communities, and how scholarly communities support scholars in precarious occupational positions.

Right now, we have some statistics in progress on non-affiliated scholars in music studies. Check it out, and drop me a line if you have any thoughts!
