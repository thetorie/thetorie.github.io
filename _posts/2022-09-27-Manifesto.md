We don't need to talk about the fact that we're not getting TT jobs anymore. It's the fact. We are not and it's not going to change. And a blog post about it isn't going to change anything. But what we CAN do is change how we support those of us who arent on the TT and who want to continue research, writing, or scholarly community engagement, either by design or out of necessity. Barring significant room for improvement, the institution has realized we aren't all going to get TT jobs and has offered alt ac training for years now. But why don't they, or the granting institutions above them, want us to stay relevant in our scholarly communities?
