There are more of us.

There are more recent PhDs without tenure track job than there are with. (cite)

And we do not have current statistics for how grave this situation has gotten in the past two years or so, since the beginning of the pandemic. What we do have are dozens of studies, think pieces, and blog posts about this crisis, stemming back from 2010 at the latest. We also have alt-ac, PhD Plus, or other euphemistic programs in hundreds of graduate departments, a sign that our administrators recongize this occupational futility but cannot forsee any solutions beyond prestige careers in consulting.

So institutions are recongizing, and dealing with the graduate trajectory statistical fallout of, the fact that most of us are not getting academic appointments, whether we sought those positions or not. And many of us are finding fulfiling careers outside of academia or adjacent institutions. Many are in career paths that were at one point unfathomable. Many never wanted a tenure track job. We all exist under this umbrella, with one uniting factor: we all were, at one point, passionate about research, writing, and our scholarly communities, and we find those activities and those connections difficult to maintain. These activities and realtionships are fostered in a system that was not designed for us. But, as I said, there are more of us.

Why are our institutions not serving us beyond degree conference? Whether that insitution is our alma mater, a granting body, or an academic/higher education society, why are they not doing more to serve the largest amount of scholars?

How can we reframe scholarly and academic communities to align with reality: most of us will not be in presitigous positions, positions in higher education or adjacent institutions whose careers and promotions tangibly benefit from scholarly publishing, conference presentations, and research granting, positions that have a symbiotic relationship with the granting institutions, nonprofits, and publishers that depend on higher profile researchers to prove to their donors that they are successful, or to continue to sell a non-zero number of books.

Those of us whose careers outside of academia do not depend on an article in the journal of record are just as worthy of participating in the scholarly community as our colleagues with tenure track jobs. Afterall, there are more of us. And imagine how rich, diverse, and complex scholarly discourse could be if its participants came from a folklife director, a government analyst, a UX designer, and a full-time parent?

As mentioned, there is a lot of discourse surrounding how to *get* a job outside academia, or how to transition from outside academia back into an academic career. Likewise, there is haughty posturing, bragging about how careers outside academia are better. But rarely are there conversations about the emptiness that follows not continuing in acadmeia post-grad, whether by choice or not. How can we continue to participate in a community that we still like, regardless of our position or title?
